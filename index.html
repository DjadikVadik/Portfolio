          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vadim: Aspiring Software Developer with a Passion for Growth</span>
          <br><br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">About Me:</span><br>
          I'm Vadim, transitioning from a fitness trainer and rehabilitation specialist at "Yes Fitness Premium" to software development. With six years in fitness, I've grown by constantly learning â€“ from anatomy to biomechanics. I've even led biomechanics courses for the Odessa region's bodybuilding federation. 
          <br><br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Why Software Development:</span><br>
          My journey into programming began with a fascination for mathematics and a Ruby course on YouTube. This led to formal education in C++, C#, and JavaScript. I excelled academically, driven by a deep interest in the field.
          <br><br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Professional Transition:</span><br>
          Seeking to grow further, I chose software development over opening a fitness studio or medical studies. I've been upfront with "Yes Fitness Premium" about my career shift, balancing work with freelance programming projects.
          <br><br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">What I Bring:</span><br>
          - Motivation: Always ready to learn and embrace new challenges.
          - Communication Skills: Refined through my fitness career, essential for teamwork and client relations.
          - Interests: Beyond programming, I enjoy chess and physical fitness.
          <br><br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Looking Ahead:</span><br>
