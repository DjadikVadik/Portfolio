          <br><br>
          <span style="text-indent: 5%;"> This is a calculator application. You can evaluate its functionality by following this link. 
          The application is written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The entire design of the application, including the logic, was crafted 
          personally without the use of external code. Additionally, a custom JavaScript function has been implemented for performing calculation 
          operations.</span><br><br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Market:</span><br><br>

          <span style="text-indent: 5%;">This is a web application developed on ASP.NET Core, providing an HTTP API to manage objects. The project is structured 
          using the "onion" architecture to facilitate project scalability.<br><br>
          
          Project Structure:<br>
          - Data models representing tasks.<br>
          - Entity Framework database context, including DbSet<TodoItem> for interacting with the tasks table.<br>
          - Controllers handling HTTP requests to manage tasks, including methods for retrieving all tasks, getting specific tasks by Id, creating new tasks, updating tasks, and deleting tasks.<br>
          - Business models representing business tasks.<br>
          - Business controllers handling the project's business logic.<br><br>
          
          Usage:<br>
          1. After launching the API application, you can interact with the following endpoints:<br>
             - GET /api/todo - Retrieve a list of all tasks.<br>
             - GET /api/todo/{id} - Get information about a task based on its Id.<br>
             - POST /api/todo - Create a new task.<br>
             - PUT /api/todo/{id} - Update information about a task based on its Id.<br>
             - DELETE /api/todo/{id} - Delete a task based on its Id.<br><br>
          
          2. Entity Framework is used for interacting with the database, automatically creating and updating the database schema based on data models.</span><br><br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Parser:</span><br><br>

          <span style="text-indent: 5%;">This application serves as a website parser and utilizes the "onion" architecture. The project operates with the console 
          for simplicity in demonstration, but the console can be easily replaced with a desktop or ASP.NET Core application if needed. 
          For database interaction, the application employs the ADO.NET framework.
          At the start, the application creates a database using the ADO.NET framework, along with stored procedures for efficient database operations. 
          The project also includes repositories and models for working with the database.
          Further, a separate parser library, using repositories, stores all data from the website (including images) in this database. Subsequently, 
          repositories are used to retrieve everything from the database, which is then demonstrated on the console.<br><br>
          
          Structure:<br><br>
          
          - Library with a class for creating the database.<br>
          - Library with models and repositories for database operations.<br>
          - Library with business models for transforming database models into business models.<br>
          - Library with business controllers for implementing business logic.<br>
          - Library for the parser itself.<br>
          - Console application for working with all these libraries</span><br><br>
